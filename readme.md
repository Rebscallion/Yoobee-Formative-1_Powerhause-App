<h3>USER EXPERIENCE DESIGN</h3>
<br>
<h3>Brief</h3>
<p>An existing electronics company is planning to release a new service for homeowners. Using a series of connected devices they intend to give customers control of their home and awareness of its health and security. Customers will be able to monitor and control their home from wall mounted tablets, and a web app accessed from anywhere using their mobile phone.</p>
<br>
<p>I based my app design around what I thought it would look like if Powershop (a New Zealand based electrical company) wanted to expand into home security/monitoring. How would they style their app so it was easy for current Powershop customers to use.</p>
<h3>This app was my first project using</h3>

- Sass
- Javascript
- Bootstrap
- Google Fonts
